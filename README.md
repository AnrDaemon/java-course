# Java courses template repository

## Usage

1. Edit the `in/hexlet/MXpY.java` files as your `App` class.
2. Import them into `org/example/hexlet/java/mX/PartYY.java` class as `App` (see the template classes, the project is actually compiles and runs).
3. Enter boilerplate code into separate exercise (`PartYY.eZ()`) or challenge (`PartYY.cZ()`) methods.
4. If you are fancy, rename the `org.example.*` namespace to the one you actually own.
5. If you want a runable JAR, tweak the `application/mainClass` in buildscript.
6. If you want to target different Java version, change the `java/toolchain/languageVersion` in buildscript.
